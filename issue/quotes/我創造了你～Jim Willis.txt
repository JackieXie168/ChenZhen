我創造了你～Jim Willis
我看著收容所中被囚禁的動物…那些被人類社會所遺棄的動物。

我在牠們眼中見到愛、希望、恐懼與害怕、悲傷與背叛。

我心中感到一股憤怒。

「上帝啊」，我說，「這是何等恐怖！你為何不做些什麼？」

上帝沉默了一會兒，然後輕輕地說。

「我做了」，祂回答。

「我創造了你。」

～Jim Willis，1999

I looked at all the caged animals in the shelter...the cast-offs of human society.
I saw in their eyes love and hope, fear and dread, sadness and betrayal.
And I was angry.
“God,” I said, “this is terrible! Why don't you do something?”
God was silent for a moment and then He spoke softly.
“I have done something,” He replied.
“I created You.”
