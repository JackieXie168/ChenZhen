當人們說「有這麼一個世界」時～維根斯坦
不管誰跟我怎麼說，我都照樣反彈，並不是因為他的說明是錯的，而是因為那是一種「說明」。如果有人告訴我一些「理論」，我會說：謝了，謝了，我對這個沒興趣。即便你講的理論正確，我也不感興趣，「那」不是我在尋找的。…

理論對「我」來說，毫無價值，毫無意義。…對我來說，一切事實也都不重要，可當人們說「有這麼一個世界」時，卻觸動我的心。

～維根斯坦與 Friedrich Waismann 的交談，於 1930. 12. 17.

Whatever one said to me, I would reject it; not because the explanation is false but because it is an EXPLANATION. If anybody offers me a THEORY, I would say: No, no, that doesn’t interest me. Even if the theory were true that would not interest me—it would not be WHAT I seek…

FOR ME the theory has no value. A theory gives me nothing. For me the facts are unimportant. But what men mean when they say that “The world is there” lies close to my heart.

～Wittgenstein in conversation with Friedrich Waismann. 1930. 12. 17.
